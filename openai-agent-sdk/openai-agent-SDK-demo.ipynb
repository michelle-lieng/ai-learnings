    "\n",
    "Core concepts:\n",
    "- Agents: LLMs configured with instructions, tools, guardrails, and handoffs\n",
    "- Handoffs: A specialized tool call used by the Agents SDK for transferring control between agents\n",
    "- Guardrails: Configurable safety checks for input and output validation\n",
    "- Sessions: Automatic conversation history management across agent runs\n",
    "- Tracing: Built-in tracking of agent runs, allowing you to view, debug and optimize your workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent loop:  \n",
    "When you call Runner.run(), we run a loop until we get a final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call the LLM, using the model and settings on the agent, and the message history.\n",
    "The LLM returns a response, which may include tool calls.\n",
    "If the response has a final output (see below for more on this), we return it and end the loop.\n",
    "If the response has a handoff, we set the agent to the new agent and go back to step 1.\n",
    "We process the tool calls (if any) and append the tool responses messages. Then we go to step 1.\n",
    "There is a max_turns parameter that you can use to limit the number of times the loop executes."
